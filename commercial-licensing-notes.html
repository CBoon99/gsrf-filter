  <h1>Zero Overshoot — Commercial &amp; Licensing Notes</h1>

  <div class="warning">
    <p><strong>Important:</strong> This document exists to prevent misuse and misunderstandings. Zero Overshoot is not open-source software. Commercial use requires explicit licensing.</p>
  </div>

  <h2>Non-Open-Source Status</h2>
  <p>Zero Overshoot is proprietary technology. The framework, algorithms, implementation patterns, and associated intellectual property are protected and not available under open-source licenses.</p>
  <p>The source code, technical specifications, and integration materials are provided under license for specific uses. Unauthorized copying, distribution, or use is prohibited.</p>
  <p>This includes but is not limited to:</p>
  <ul>
    <li>Reverse engineering the algorithms or implementation patterns</li>
    <li>Distributing modified or unmodified versions of Zero Overshoot code</li>
    <li>Incorporating Zero Overshoot into open-source projects</li>
    <li>Publishing implementation details without permission</li>
  </ul>

  <h2>Research vs Commercial Use Distinction</h2>
  <p><strong>Research use</strong> refers to non-commercial evaluation, testing, and academic research. Research use may be permitted under specific terms that do not include production deployment or commercial exploitation.</p>
  <p>Research use does <em>not</em> include:</p>
  <ul>
    <li>Internal tools used by commercial organizations</li>
    <li>Proof-of-concept systems intended for eventual commercial deployment</li>
    <li>Systems used to generate revenue, even if indirectly</li>
    <li>Systems used to provide services to customers</li>
  </ul>
  <p><strong>Commercial use</strong> includes any deployment in a production system, whether customer-facing or internal, that supports business operations or generates value. Commercial use requires a commercial license.</p>
  <p>If you are unsure whether your use case qualifies as research or commercial, contact <a href="mailto:info@boonmind.io">info@boonmind.io</a> before deployment.</p>

  <h2>Licensing Requirement for Production Systems</h2>
  <p>Any production deployment of Zero Overshoot requires a commercial license. "Production" means any system that is:</p>
  <ul>
    <li>Deployed for operational use (as opposed to testing or evaluation)</li>
    <li>Used to make real decisions or control real systems</li>
    <li>Available to end users or customers</li>
    <li>Part of a commercial offering or service</li>
  </ul>
  <p>Licensing terms are negotiated on a case-by-case basis and typically include:</p>
  <ul>
    <li>Scope of permitted use (specific systems, products, or services)</li>
    <li>Duration of license</li>
    <li>Support and update provisions</li>
    <li>Redistribution and sublicensing restrictions</li>
  </ul>
  <p>Failure to obtain a license for production use constitutes a violation of intellectual property rights and may result in legal action.</p>

  <h2>No Resale / Redistribution Without Agreement</h2>
  <p>You may not resell, redistribute, sublicense, or otherwise transfer Zero Overshoot without explicit written agreement. This includes:</p>
  <ul>
    <li>Selling Zero Overshoot as a product or service</li>
    <li>Including Zero Overshoot in products or services you sell</li>
    <li>Distributing Zero Overshoot to third parties</li>
    <li>Offering Zero Overshoot functionality as a hosted service</li>
    <li>Including Zero Overshoot in open-source or publicly available code</li>
  </ul>
  <p>If you wish to incorporate Zero Overshoot into a product or service that will be sold or distributed, you must negotiate a distribution agreement that specifies the scope of permitted redistribution.</p>

  <h2>Support and Integration Scope Boundaries</h2>
  <p>Support and integration assistance are provided according to the terms of your specific license or engagement agreement. General support boundaries include:</p>
  <ul>
    <li><strong>In scope:</strong> Zero Overshoot framework integration, parameter configuration, validation methodology, and framework-specific technical questions</li>
    <li><strong>Out of scope:</strong> General system architecture, unrelated software development, ongoing operational support, or custom feature development beyond the Zero Overshoot framework</li>
  </ul>
  <p>Support is provided on a best-effort basis within the scope of Zero Overshoot integration. Response times and support levels depend on your license or engagement terms.</p>
  <p>Integration support does not include:</p>
  <ul>
    <li>Guaranteed system performance or uptime</li>
    <li>Liability for system failures or damages</li>
    <li>Ongoing maintenance of your system</li>
    <li>Development of custom algorithms beyond Zero Overshoot</li>
  </ul>

  <h2>Jurisdiction-Neutral Wording</h2>
  <p>These notes are written to be broadly applicable across jurisdictions. Specific legal terms, enforceability, and dispute resolution mechanisms are defined in your license or engagement agreement, which may include jurisdiction-specific provisions.</p>
  <p>If you are operating in a jurisdiction with specific requirements for software licensing, intellectual property protection, or liability limitations, these should be addressed in your specific agreement.</p>
  <p>Zero Overshoot intellectual property is protected under applicable patent, copyright, and trade secret laws. Enforcement of these rights is subject to the laws of the relevant jurisdictions and the terms of your specific agreement.</p>

  <div class="warning">
    <p><strong>Summary:</strong> Zero Overshoot requires a commercial license for production use. Research and evaluation may be permitted under different terms. Redistribution and resale require explicit agreement. Contact <a href="mailto:info@boonmind.io">info@boonmind.io</a> for licensing inquiries.</p>
